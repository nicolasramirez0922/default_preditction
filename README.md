# default_preditction
This corresponds to a Technical test that I completed

Clasification model to predict the probability that a given transactions is defaulted (does not receive payment) the next month.

Model results and potential strategies based on them are described at the end of the Notebook.

This is not intended as a production level code but as an exploratory analysis together with model ideation.

I only used Random Forest approach to have a first contact with the problem at hand.

A few potential data_quality issued where found and are described on the Notebook.
